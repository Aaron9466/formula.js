JavaScript implementation of most Microsoft Excel formula functions.

This library is under development.

This was forked from the awesome guys at [sutoiku](https://github.com/sutoiku/formula.js/), the reason being we wanted to do a more agressive refactor, modularize the code, remove formulas that do not exist in Excel and do error handling in a different way.
